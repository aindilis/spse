Shared Priority System Editor

System to edit planning information

The Shared Priority System Editor allows us to rapidly edit and relate
sets of goals and to place constraints upon them such as what they
depend on for completion, and what time constraints there are related
to them.  All of this information is then exported into a set of
assertions that can be systematically reasoned with in order to
generate appropriate plans.  Various natural language processing
techniques, such as Textual Entailment Recognition, are applied to
aiding in the elicitation and breaking-down of knowledge about the
situation being planned.  Also, recently, we have added tools for
visualizing not just planning domains but a large number of other
domains requiring similar interactive graph based visualizaition.

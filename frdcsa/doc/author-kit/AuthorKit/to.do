(replace I, we)
(figure out multi-agent)


(NL questions (how do you hyphenate "wifi-signal-strenth-based"))

(include information about the location aware wifi-signal
 strength based house system)

(mention interfaces to the other cron schedule based system)

(mention the temporal plan that was developed - the hygiene plan
 - mention that it was trialed briefly by a homeless person)

(talk about the multiagent modes of the system, the "shared" part of SPSE2)

(emphasize eventual integration into linux
 distributions (provided planning software is freely licensed),
 possible download, talk to system holders)

# look into verber more to get an idea of what to say about that


Planner Library


Automated Goal Analyis
	Conversion of Statements to Verber subdomain, linking entities, conversions of English predicates to predicates, etc, normalization, timing, not worth the time yet - still more important tasks
Automatic Execution of Tasks
	Setanta-Agent, FRDCSAL
POSI Collaboration
	Interested in collabing with others in the field on an open source basis, using POSI to store interests, brief mention of POSI, ontology of research interests, share free planning systems that do more
Ontology of Planning Systems and Their Capabilities
	As part of CSO, deriving software ontology of planning systems, write wrappers, use as part of this
;; Temporal Conformant Planning
;; 	Basic functionality in leiu of temporal conformant planners is to fork domain at each environmental decision point and generate plan - store plan hierarchy, also which nodes have no plan and require domain reengineering

Time Constraints
	Recurring time constraints, using ICS format

Accessibility Theorem Proving, other positional features

Plan Preferences
	Similar to the temp conf. planning, simply try to achieve
	the plan using the stricted rules, if can't, relax all
	rules by 1 level, see if that is achievable, if it is,
	try to improve it within allowed planning process time
	constraints

Android User Interface

Plan Cycle
	Planning for the Planning Process, mention stuff from frdcsa.org

Planning Domain Analyses
	Goal importance, strategic next actions (possibly quote that book (take back your life)), etc 

Goal Helpers
	Additional information for actions such as contacting others (through Audience subsystem), various plan libraries, plan library inclusion structure

Interfacing Other Sources Of Knowledge Into The Planning Process
	Viewing conformant plan structure, Multi-agent Doxastic Logics, Discourse Representation Theory



Systems Using This System
	Akahige Medical System, Meal Planning System, Story Understanding and Generation

House Rules






Things to keep in mind:

	Talk about your sympathy vote - a system written by a schizophrenic for schizophrenics

	Emphasize the applied nature as opposed to advancing the planning process itself.
	
	Sync editor and use on laptop.  Edit the paper in the editor.  Concepts in the editor.

SPSE2 is a free and open source software system for personal task
management that uses publicly available temporal planning systems and
tools.  It provides a GUI for users to edit planning domains
consisting of assertions about goals and their interrelations and
temporal, cost and other constraints.  It also integrates calendar and
transportation planning information.  A voice-controlled mobile
application on the Android platform for goal setting, interactive
execution monitoring and replanning is currently under development.
The rest of this paper concerns details and planned features,
application areas and future work; as well as various other AI-related
technologies being used to extend the usefulness of the core
functionality.  For example, computational semantics software will
extract models of the meaning of the goals and translate into elements
of the planning language, and deontic logics will help to determine
the consistency of the goals and plans with the user's preferred
ethics and value systems.  The work is being conducted as part of the
Cognitive Prostheses research focus of the FRDCSA project.

\section{Introduction}

This paper documents progress within the Formalized Research Database;
Cluster, Study and Apply (FRDCSA) project towards applying existing AI
planning and scheduling tools to the domain of personal task
management.  I am developing this tool for general use, but
particularly for 1) those with disabilities impairing so-called
executive skills, and 2) those in poverty who can only secure basic
needs with difficulty.  Disabilities that affect executive skills
include Pervasive Developmental Disorders such as Autism and
Schizophrenia.  ``They are called executive skills because they help
people execute tasks.  Every person has a set of 12 executive skills
(self-restraint, working memory, emotion control, focus, task
initiation, planning/prioritization, organization, time management,
defining and achieving goals, flexibility, observation and stress
tolerance)'' \cite{cio2006}.  Additionally, the proliferation of
inexpensive solar-powerable, wifi-enabled, Android-based smart phones,
combined with free software, has provided a novel vector to help to
supply the homeless or similarly disadvantaged with practical,
survival-oriented computing resources.  Annecdotal evidence suggests
further that the executive skills of those even without such limiting
factors still may have room for improvement, especially when compared
to a more optimal automated negotiation and coordination of temporal
constraints and privacy preferences.  Such improvements in local
planning efficacy and resource utilization could have macroscopic
effects and relax otherwise exacerbated resource conflicts.
Additionally, the application of user-defined ethical analytics
through computational deontology offers a method to constrain the
space of possible actions that are available to intelligent personal
agents.  Therefore, development of a free and open source (FOSS)
personal task management system that interfaces with existing sources
of data such as calendars, routing applications and mobile phones
promises to help to improve the quality of life generally.

\subsection{Overview of the FRDCSA Project}

\noindent The first and major goal of the FRDCSA project, 11 years and
running, is to help to provide for better security and quality of life
for all sentient beings.  A major assumption is that FOSS artificial
intelligence, engineered correctly and with unlimited redistribution,
satisfices this goal.  To avoid polemics, I am concernly only with
implementing a restricted form of weak AI.  The approach, motivated by
algorithmic information theory and information-theoretic computational
complexity of metamathematics \cite{chaitin1974}, has two prongs - to
develop an increasingly complete theorem proving system and library
(called Formalized Research Database (FRD)), and to develop an
increasingly complete collection of practical software (Cluster, Study
and Apply (CSA)).  I speculate that the two approaches are in some
sense theoretically equivalent by the Curry-Howard ismorphism, which
would seem to say that the classes of programs and proofs are
coextensive.  So ideally the FRD is a practical, transfinite
implementation of Hilbert's program, which can never be completed, but
which can, by engineering a sequence of logics each more complete than
the previous, decide in the limit all problems that are not absolutely
undecideable (should any of those exist).  This idea may be similar to
or the same as one of Turing of creating a sequence of logics, each
more complete than the previous, based upon the assumption of the
existence of increasingly large constructible ordinals
\cite{turing1939}.  Alternatively, the CSA consists of a set of
programs for building and packaging most or all known freely available
software systems and datasets.
%% Completed

The primary goal of the project and limitations to personal
productivity necessitate the development of tools, including a
personal task management system, which provide tangible benefits to
all users and in particular those working on FOSS software
development.  Yet such a system has been reasonably difficult to
engineer, as evidenced by the almost 10 such systems in various stages
of completion.  It has also been difficult to find an accurate name
for this entire collection of functionality.

\subsection{Overview of the SPSE2 System}

\noindent SPSE2 is a system for personal task management.  It provides
a GUI for users to edit planning domains.  These domains consist of
assertions in a knowledge base regarding goals, their interrelations,
and constraints of types such as temporal and cost.  This GUI allows
users to specify the constraints, and then the domain is converted
into a PDDL domain and a plan generated.  Future versions will include
a fully functional and reengineered interactive execution monitor that
will walk the users through the plans and allow replanning from
hands-free, voice-controlled cell phones.  Ideally the interface would
expand to include the interactive initiation of more types of plans
than linear.  There are several primary FRDCSA systems involved
architecturally, including the Universal Language (UniLang), Free
Knowledge-Based System v2 (FreeKBS2), Verber, and Planning, Scheduling and
Execution (PSE) systems.

\section{System Architecture}

\subsection{Shared Priority System Editor}

The name SPSE2 derives from Justin Coslor's concept of Priority Systems
\cite{coslor2008}.  Our goal system is straightfoward, it has goals as
nodes, unary predicates as conditions, and binary predicates as edges.

\noindent Here is related metadata from a sample goal in a planning
domain.  Suppose {\tt <REL>} is {\tt ("entry-fn" "pse" "38")}:

\begin{footnotesize}
\begin{verbatim}
("asserter" <REL> "unknown")
("goal" <REL>)
("has-NL" <REL> "ICAPS 2011 Paper")
("has-source" <REL>
 ("entry-fn" "sayer-index" "806"))
("depends" <REL> ("entry-fn" "pse" "17"))
...
\end{verbatim}
\end{footnotesize}

Goals are straightforwardly expressed in natural language, and may be
marked with the unary predicate {\bf complete}.  Additional common
predicates include {\bf depends}, {\bf provides}, {\bf eases} and {\bf
  prefer}.  The user uses SPSE2 to develop a planning domain, which is
stored in a FreeKBS2 context (equivalent more or less to CYC's
microtheories).  From this SPSE2 planning domain, the Verber system
then generates a PDDL domain.  I am postponing implemention of more
complex models of the semantics of processes until the basic system is
completed.  Ideally, I would like to be able to model goals that are
ongoing or come up repeatedly (i.e. do the laundry).  For now, it
simply concerns whether a given goal has been completed.  (However,
there are other related predicates: {\bf showstopper}, {\bf deleted},
{\bf cancelled}, {\bf ridiculous}, {\bf obsoleted}, {\bf rejected},
and {\bf skipped}.)

SPSE2 is being extended to become a knowledge editor, by adding
several additional node types and predicate sets and background
knowledge.  There is also a domain for general knowledge modeling.
The GUI has special functions for each domain.  Domains under
development include:\\

\noindent {\it Alethic, Argumentation, CLEAR, Contexts, Critic, Deontic, DiscourseRepresentation, Doxastic, Genealogy, IntelligentAgent, IntelligentTutoring, Inventory, Metamathematics, NetworkMapper, PICForm, Planning, POSI, SocialNetworking, SuppositionalReasoner, Tactics, Temporal, Workflow}\\
%% Completed

\subsection{FreeKBS2}

Knowledge is stored in FreeKBS2.  FreeKBS2 can convert between several
notations (KIF, Emacs and Perl Interlingua, CycL, etc) and will
eventually have more backends besides the current Vampire-KIF backend,
enabling reasoning over higher-order and modal logics.  Vampire
provides first-order theorem proving with equality.
%% Completed

\subsection{Verber}

In order to generate a plan, SPSE2 translates its domain into one
usable by Verber.  Verber, named after the late Senior Chess Master
Richard Verber, is basically a wrapper around various PDDL planners.
Verber provides a set of Perl modules for building and interacting
with PDDL domains (and hopefully other planning formalisms eventually)
for calling various planners and parsing the results.  It also houses
a primitive knowledge engineering aspect for constructing .verb format
planning domain libraries tailored to the specific domains required in
the project, such as movement discipline, goal tracking and meal
planning.  The Verb format is a very lightly extended PDDL, which
allows importing other domains and problems and also a way to convert
between PDDL's scalar time values and actual dates and times.
%% Completed

Ideally Verber is capable of observation, learning the average and
worst case durations of certain types of actions or events, and
incorporating this into the plan development.
%% Completed

Currently, there are several planners that are partially integrated,
but so far LPG-TD is used primarly \cite{gerevini2004}.
%% Completed

\subsection{UniLang}

\noindent The UniLang system is an interprocess communication system
for Perl ``agents''.  UniLang is loosely termed a multi-agent system,
patterned off of the Open Agent Architecture, but without most of the
Prolog-based communication capabilities (although it does have a
trivial FreeKBS2-based knowledge interchange capability).  Most agents,
such as FreeKBS2, Verber and SPSE2 main and temporary agents,
communicate with each other through the {\bf Send} or {\bf QueryAgent}
functions.
%% Completed

\subsection{PSE}

\noindent PSE stands for Planning, Scheduling and Execution.  It is
one of the older FRDCSA planning systems.  While the original design
using object-oriented Perl code has entirely been replaced with the
PDDL-based approach through Verber, there still remains a significant
set of Emacs elisp code within the namespace that works with the new
Verber model.  Before SPSE2, Emacs was the primary way of interacting
with the planning system.  Several interfaces were developed for
manipulation of goals.  Significant to note are the functions for
rapidly asserting relations between goals.  A stack-based interface,
similar to an RPN scientific calculator, exists for pushing textual
entities under the Emacs point onto the current stack, operating on
the contents of the current stack and ring of stacks, and asserting
into FreeKBS2.  One such function will return the entry ID of the goal
corresponding to the text under the Emacs point.  This interface is
still very much under development for the Natural Language
Understanding (NLU) system and the Knowledge-Max editor (KMax)
systems, allowing semantic markup of text and consequent rapid
manipulation of symbolic, textual knowledge.
%% Completed

\section{System Interfaces}

\subsection{Calendar Synchronization}

In order to improve the utility of Verber, a calendar synchronization
feature has been developed.  This allows synchronization with ICS
Calendars or Google Calendars, the ICS files for which are obtained
and then translated into the SPSE2 domain representation.  In order to
schedule an event occuring at a certain time, it is translated from
the date and time information into the offset and scale of the scalar
planning time value.  The event start date is marked using PDDL timed
initial literals.

\begin{footnotesize}
\begin{verbatim}
(at 1.00 (possible <EVENT>))
(at 2.00 (not (possible <EVENT>)))
\end{verbatim}
\end{footnotesize}

Additionally the planning domain includes the following precondition
for the durative action {\bf Complete}.

\begin{footnotesize}
\begin{verbatim}
(over all
 (or
  (not (has-time-constraints ?e1))
  (possible ?e1)))
\end{verbatim}
\end{footnotesize}

Here is an example of the time constraints that are asserted by the
DateTime interface.

\begin{footnotesize}
\begin{verbatim}
("end-date"
 ("entry-fn" "pse" "38")
 "TZID=America/Chicago:20101129T120000")
\end{verbatim}
\end{footnotesize}
%% Completed

\subsection{Notification Manager}

\noindent We have partially completed a Perl/TK-based notification
manager patterned off of the Android notification manager.  Ideally,
it would be able to synchronize with the Android notification manager.
%% Completed

Certain tasks that regularly occur are regularly added to the SPSE2
planning context by a cron job.  The custom cron-like format includes
information on how much warning time should predate the beginning of
the possibility of completing a task.
%% Completed

\begin{figure}[h!]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=84mm]{images/ps/notification-manager.ps}
  \caption{Notification Manager}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Deontic and Teleologic Logics}

\noindent I would like to make it possible for users to place certain
ethical constraints on possible actions, in order to provide their
agents with a moral decision support system.  In support of this, work
is ongoing to formalize various systems of morality in terms of
deontic logics, and to provide an evaluation function which evaluates
individual actions and plans against various selected moral systems.
Therefore, the user simply declares the moral systems to which they
agree, and the system then evaluates the actions.  To illustrate a
glaring but simple example, let us consider the Ten Commandments,
specifically the obligation that ``Thou shalt not kill''.  If our
computational semantics lacked understanding of general prohibitions,
perhaps this could be manually translated to ``Someone or something
murdered''.  This is then converted to a logic form <LF> and we
assert:
%% Completed

\begin{footnotesize}
\begin{verbatim}
(implies <LF> (rule-activated <RULE-NUMBER>))
\end{verbatim}
\end{footnotesize}

We then determine whether this rule is activated using semantic
textual entailment recognition.  The recognizer would load the logic
of the plan and all enumerable consequences, convert to logic form,
instantiate the variables with their valuations, add contingent
background knowledge, and query: (rule-activated ?X), relaxing the
lexical constraints until a rule is activated.  Of course, in practice
this will be more complicated.
%% Completed

Besides considering general obligations and prohibitions (deontics),
it should also be useful to consider a means-ends analysis
(teleologics).
%% Completed

\subsection{World State Comparision and Value Systems}

\noindent An intended capability is to enable reasoning intelligently
about the value of a given plan or outcome.  In trying to evaluate
various actions to determine which are morally superior according to
various moral theories, it begs the question of which world-states and
histories are preferable.  To evaluate this, we need to develop a
general comparison function.  To reduce the evaluation to a total
order would be somewhat dualistic - but ultimately we would like the
user to be able to choose preferable from among possible worlds - or
rather provide rules which in some sense order them.
%% Completed

\subsection{Android Bluetooth Headset Based Interactive Execution Monitor}

\noindent In order to provide a usable interface to the plans, I am
developing an application for the Google Android mobile operating
system, for recording new goals, walking the user through generated
plans, and initiating replanning.  Currently, we have a functioning
client-server system that communicates between the phone and server
using XMLRPC.  This functionality actually resides within UniLang.  A
limited set of voice commands has been developed, enabling the phone
to for instance answer factoid based questions using our agent
wrapping the open source OpenEphyra question answering system.  We
will illustrate the use case for this kind of question answering.  The
user intiates the speech interface by pressing a certain combination
of buttons on their bluetooth headset, currently only the media
button.  Recognition occurs using Google's voice recognition API, and
results are then sent via XMLRPC to the Android-FRDCSA-Server UniLang
agent.  The command is processed by a VoiceCommand module, which in
this use case sends a query to the QUAC Question Answering system,
before ultimately returning the message.
%% Completed

Previously, we had a text-based interactive execution monitor which
used the Sphinx2 numeric domain and TTS to query the user as to the
status of the completed plan.  Thus, it is not hard to imagine
adapting the current text-based interactive execution manager to work
on the Android phone.  Progress was delayed for months while my phone
become broken (the shadow of the Leviathon protects it), but thanks to
my sister Kate a test unit has recently been procured.
%% Completed

Initiating communication to the phone, on the other hand, while more
difficult, may be accomplished either through registering the phone
with a dynamic-DNS provider, or by polling from the phone to the
server.  Voice commands for controlling the process of planning,
replanning and the interactive execution monitor will be developed.
%% Completed

Development of the interactive execution monitor, especially one that
incorporates conditional planning for various possible interaction
situations (such as whether the user is in the presence of the phone
or the computer), will be more difficult.
%% Completed

\subsection{Location Logic}

\noindent Location Logic is a system for inferencing with the
semantics of logic related to the users' physical locations as
reported by the GPS (or in the multiagent case using location services
like Google Latitude), as contrasted to their waypoint data.  It works
by asserting theorems observed regarding the GPS tracks, such as
whether certain waypoints are being approached, visited, or departed.
Location Logic interfaces naturally with the SPSE2 system.  Locational
restrictions will be extracted from goals using named entity
recognition and computational semantics.
%% Completed

Eventually, I would like to add multiagent, distributed planning
solvers to be able to resolve distributed resource problems.

Here is an example use case.  Suppose both Alice and Bob are using
mobile phones having the hands-free voice-controlled task list and
Location Logic systems installed.  Both Alice and Bob are wearing
bluetooth headsets.

So suppose Alice is out of milk, but she doesn't know this right away.
(Perhaps her roommate drank the last of it, and did not or could not
tell her yet).  Meanwhile, Bob is out running errands of his own.

Alice wakes up and comes down the stairs and goes to get some cereal.
She pours the bowl of cereal and then looks in her refrigerator.  She
realizes that the milk is empty and has not been thrown out.

Disappointed, she taps a button on her bluetooth headset.  It responds
``Yes?''.  Alice says: ``pantry remove item milk'', to which her
headset responds, ``Confirm remove milk from pantry inventory?''.
Alice says ``yes'' and the headset responds ``Milk removed''.

When Alice tells the system that she was out of milk - the system
realizes according to various considerations that she should buy some
more milk.  It therefore automatically added the goal ``get milk''.

\begin{figure}[h!]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=84mm]{images/ps/location-logic.ps}
  \caption{Location Logic Prototype}
\end{figure}

Because Alice and Bob are friends, they have already told their Shared
Priority Systems that they can collaborate on several matters, one of
which is food inventory.  Perhaps Alice's planning agent sent a
broadcast to all of her friends with which she shares this particular
kind of information.  It was stated simply as the goal that there
should be a fresh jug of milk in Alice's refrigerator.  The various
agents therefore add this goal to their own planning systems.

Collectively, at the next planning or replanning cycle, using a
distributed planning formalism, they agree on the details of the least
costly and most preferable plan that incorporates Alice's request.

Bob's planning agent and ethical analyzer agree to propose to Bob the
task of picking up and dropping off milk to Alice's house, because he
was approaching a grocery store, didn't have other things that
couldn't be slightly postponed, and his adjustable autonomy settings
allowed for the proposal.

Bob and perhaps Alice get a message suggesting that this action be
taken.  Once both have agreed, it is added to the planning system,
even including so much as to tell Bob's cell phone agent which type of
milk Alice would like.

Bob then purchases the milk and then swings by Alice's place on his
way to work.  For now, we can assume Alice pays him cash - but in the
future we will use an automated loan/payment system currently under
development.

The usefulness of the milk provision scenario is debatable, but
certainly in the general case such efficient team-based collaboration
would be very desireable, as for instance in the case of ride-sharing,
shared task management, and so on.
%% Completed

Here follows an example Location Logic rule.

\begin{footnotesize}
\begin{verbatim}
(implies
 (and
  (leaving ?AGENT ?LOCATION)
  (isa ?LOCATION movie-theatre)
  (has-performed-action ?AGENT
   "silence cell phone at movie theatres")
  ;; (> (sitting-still) (minute 1))
  )
 (perform-action "add-to-pending-tasks"
  "unsilence cell phone \
   when leaving movie theatres"))
\end{verbatim}
\end{footnotesize}

\subsection{Federated Transportation Planning}

\noindent I have also integrated a federated transporation planning
option.  Previously, the FRDCSA BusRoute planner
(\url{http://frdcsa.org/frdcsa/internal/busroute}) had been integrated
with Verber, but will be replaced with the advent of Google's public
transportation planner.  This interface should naturally understand
waypoints, and be able to generate queries to a public or private
transportation routing system in order to populate the planning domain
with the timing constraints.  Ideally services transmitting actual bus
positions and timing could be integrated - and replanning initiated as
needed.
%% Completed

\section{Systems Using SPSE2/Verber/PSE}

\subsection{POSI Collaboration}

\noindent The planning system and interactive execution monitor have
several applications.  One related project using the tools of the
FRDCSA is the POSI Open Source Initiative (POSI)
(\url{http://intranet.posi.frdcsa.org}). It is a project for
representing the goals, interests and abilities of its users, as
distilled from their writings and volunteered information.  The idea
is to establish necessary and sufficient information to form dynamic
multiagent teams to solve problems that are shared between multiple
persons.  Priority Systems are essentially networks of goals and
constraints on these goals.  Future versions of SPSE will be able to
simultaneously edit the same Shared Priority Systems.  I am
contemplating various models of shared editing.  Ideally, when someone
marks a goal as completed, the other SPSE agents should display such
changes.  An analogy can be made to a real-time strategy game.  An
essential feature of POSI is identifying when different users have
specified the same or related goals.  This is accomplished chiefly
using the nascent technology of Textual Entailment Recognition, as
well as through breaking down individual goals into more clearly
defined or achievable steps.
%% Completed

As such, the Goals, Interests and Abilities (GIAs) of the users are
modeled using ontological tools.  SPSE2 itself soon will have the
ability to edit domains besides temporal planning, including different
ontologies such as the POSI ontologies.
%% Completed

\subsection{Akahige Medical System}
Another intended application is the Akahige Medical System
(\url{http://frdcsa.org/frdcsa/internal/akahige}).  One capability of
the Android phone-based general purpose help system under development
is to launch a medical help system in the event that any conspicuous
symptoms occur or at regularly scheduled times.  Symptoms may be run
through a standard or custom medical diagnostic program (such as
Diagnosaurus or the planned Akahige Model-Based Diagnostic and Fault
Localization software).  The result of the diagnostic procedure may
require an emergency response.  In such a case, instructions for the
given emergency or situation will exist within the system and the user
will be guided by the interactive execution monitor to complete these
tasks, and to refer to documentation as needed.
%% Completed

\subsection{Gourmet Meal Planner}

Another area of significant interest is meal planning.  The FRDCSA
project includes a meal planner, called Gourmet
(\url{http://frdcsa.org/frdcsa/internal/gourmet}). It will interface
with our inventory management component for pantry management.  The
SOAR archive of around 150,000 meal-master recipes is being
integrated.  Work is progressing on developing a foodstuffs ontology,
upon which to map the ingredients and intermediate foodstuffs of
recipes.  Mapping to nutrient databases such as the SR23 and also to
product databases such as UPCdatabase.com, in addition to formalizing
the recipe steps into discrete planning operations, will provide all
the resources required to achieve interactive recipe execution through
the Android interface.  The formalization of recipe steps will
hopefully be attempted by training CMU's StackedFrameParser on the
CURD/MILK dataset of annotated recipes.  They use a medium grained
language called CURD which expresses a set of abstracted operations on
food and intermediate foodstuffs \cite{tasse2008}.  Then arbitrary
English recipes may be attempted.  As some other open source meal
planners have well established user bases, this automatic annotation
could be performed and cached by a webserver (as the
StackedFrameParser requires 8GB of RAM), and could be augmented and
trained by user corrections given a sufficient GUI and upload
mechanism.
%% Completed

\subsection{Paperless-Office System}

Another FRDCSA project that will make use of the planning technology
is the Paperless-Office (\url{http://freshmeat.net/paperless-office}).
With this system, which already functions to scan, OCR, search and
edit documents, it will be possible to specify workflows - such as
certain documents requiring to be filled out and sent by certain
times.
%% Completed
\begin{figure}[h!]
  \centering
      \includegraphics[width=84mm]{images/ps/paperless-office.ps}
  \caption{Paperless-Office}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Story Understanding and Generation}

An area of interest is in story understanding and generation (not to
mention poetry).  So for instance, the exposition structure of this
LaTeX paper was modelled using a planning domain, although specialized
domains are/will be developed.  These domains necessarily use the
various other the domains, such as multiagent modeling capabilities,
of SPSE2 - to model what the authors intended effects are on the
audience and to generate stories that match these goals.

\subsection{SystemX Intelligent Tutoring Systems}

Work has been ongoing on Arbitrary Document Understanding.  Being able
to represent the argument structure of a text, and also the facts and
relations of the text, enables the generation of temporal plans for
teaching subjects at various granularities based on various learning
objectives and timing constraints.  A prototype system called Study
has been developed.  SystemX will use the SPSE2 or its derivatives.

\section{Conclusions and Future Work}

\noindent We are close to completing usable Perl/TK, Emacs and Android
systems for editing goals, adding temporal constraints, generating
plans, and walking the user through them.  The chief obstacle to the
release of this work, other than the work itself, is that the software
developed depends on a large set of heavily interconnected yet
unreleased software dependencies.  I would like to see a proper
requirements engineer process initiated (as the project management for
SPSE2 is currently performed within SPSE2 itself - a chicken and egg
problem).  I need to get a working phone and complete the interactive
execution monitor - as well as resolve some pernicious bugs.

Automatic Execution of Tasks.  One interesting area of the system is
to take the planning capabilities of the system, and existing plan
instantiation libraries, and use this information to achieve automatic
completions of portions of the plan, and also a generic user

Computational Semantics Via Logic Forms

\subsection{Automatic PDDL Domain Construction Via Computational Semantics}

\noindent Although goals are simply evaluated in a boolean context, we
are working on providing a more detailed interpretation of the
semantics of the goals.  Ideally, we would convert the natural
language contents of goals and other node types into a logical
semantic representation, such as logic forms (LFs), and from the LFs
construct the PDDL domains and problems.

\subsection{Suppositional Reasoner}

\noindent The suppositional reasoner seeks to incorporate more
positional evaluation and analysis of domain invariants, domain
specific knowledge and so on, into the planning process.  It ideally
would function as a plan development and critiquing interface for
real-life problems, hopefully allowing the evaluation of any decision
making process.  It is being calibrated on domains like Chess and Go
that have a substantial literature that may be formalized and in which
feedback on efficacy is relatively short.  From a search point of
view, it is not very interesting, for starters we are going to
implement some standard searches.  But attempting to hybridize the
search with positional information is interesting.  We are taking
annotated chess games and formalizing the annotations to develop
knowledge that may be tested and applied to the situation.

We also have a formalization for theorem proving over these models.
It is the same formalization that being used to perform natural
language understanding within the project.  It is the Sayer system.

\subsection{Temporal Conformant Planning}

One desired capability is temporal conformant planning, and tools for
exploring the set of actions possible to the agent at each state, and
reasoning with the consequences of various choices at that point.
This naturally reflects back to the suppositional reasoner and the
valuation system.

%% Basic functionality in leiu of temporal conformant planners is to fork
%% domain at each environmental decision point and generate plan - store
%% plan hierarchy, also which nodes have no plan and require domain
%% reengineering
